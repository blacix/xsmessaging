# xsmessaging

xsmessaging is a extra small messaging library for stream based communication.

  - it defines a simple packet format with delimiter and escape charcter
  - it uses crc for integrity check

Note that it is only a hobby project. 
I often have to implement stuff like this, so I decided to create a simple library for myself.
